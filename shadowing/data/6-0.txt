In spite of Mrs. Huber's disappearance, life on Wisteria Lane started to return to normal until an intriguing discovery was made on a dirt road next to the interstate.

This is officer Burton. I have an abandoned vehicle registered to a missing person, one Martha Huber. Please advise.

As news spread of this mysterious development, everyone in the neighborhood decided to band together to show their support, and look for the clues, or worse.

I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon. Please tell me if I am about to step on a body part.

It's a search and rescue, not recover. We don't know if she's dead.

Yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time.

Could we talk about something else, something less depressing?

Well, here's something-- Mike told me he loved me.

Oh, my god!

Over here! They found the body!

No, I'm sorry! False alarm! We didn't find a body. Uh, Susan just had some really good news. Sorry.

It was nothing. False alarm.

Well, doesn't that figure? Susan always finds a way to make it about her.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the fabulous Buick lacrosse.

It has expertly crafted interior, peaceful, quiet tuning, and ultra-sonic rear parking assist.

Observe the remote activation feature.

Uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting, good, cool car things.

Tom, Lynette. What are you doing here?

We're buying a new water heater. Um, how about you?

Just doing a little shopping, trying to get my mind off things.

Hey, Gabby, you need help? It looks like you're stuck here.

Oh, I guess I am.

No worries. I got it.

Guess I got too close to the turntable. I'm a sucker for these Buicks.

Come on, you bastard.

You know, with their perfectly crafted interior and peaceful, quiet tuning.

Uh-huh. Little formal for the mall.

Oh, uh, you know, I wanted to match the shoes to the dress.

This is Sarah, my shopping buddy. We like to hit the boutiques together.

Okay, well, you gals, shop your little hearts out. See you later.

Bye.
